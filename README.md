# I found yet another python library I wanted to try, I made these projects using the ursina engine in python. 

# Spaceship game
It is a 2 player spaceship game where you have to shoot around the asteroids while trying to hit the other player.
The background moves to give the effet of travelling through space. 

unfinished -> It has some small features unfinished - no proper end screen, only one bullet at a time needs to be fixed

# 3D ursina use
I wanted to use ursinas 3D models as I found it so interesting that a simple couple of line could render in 3D graphics
espically the fact its written in python

This small project shows what I learned from the documentation and various videos. It has a moveable cube that can hit 
the walls, the walls change texture and colour to signify the walls health is diminishing, the cube eventually breaks
both walls and the program ends
